---
File 0-print_listint.c is a function that prints all the elements of a listint_t list.<br>

File 1-listint_len.c is a function that returns the number of elements in a linked listint_t list.<br>

File 2-add_nodeint.c is a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a listint_t list.<br>

File 3-add_nodeint_end.c is a function that adds a new node at the end of a listint_t list.<br>

File 4-free_listint.c is a function that frees a listint_t list.<br>

File 5-free_listint2.c is a function that frees a listint_t list and sets the head pointer to NULL.<br>

File 6-pop_listint.c is a function that deletes the head node of a listint_t linked list, and returns the head nodeâ€™s data (n).<br>

File 7-get_nodeint.c is a function that returns the nth node of a listint_t linked list.<br>

File 8-sum_listint.c is a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a listint_t linked list.<br>

File 9-insert_nodeint.c is a function that inserts a new node at a given position.<br>

File 10-delete_nodeint.c is a function that deletes the node at index index of a listint_t linked list.<br>

File 100-reverse_listint.c is a function that reverses a linked list.<br>

File 101-print_listint_safe.c is a function that prints a listint_t linked list, safely.<br>

File 102-free_listint_safe.c is a function that frees a listint_t list, safely.<br>

File 103-find_loop.c is a function that finds the loop in a linked list.<br>

File lists.h is the header file containing all these function prototypes and the data structure listint_t.<br>
